# Project Objective
This project creates a data pipline using US congressional data from GovInfo.gov and Congress.gov. 

While Congress originates and votes on various types of bills each year, this project seeks to create greater clarity around the types of bills that Congress addresses on a yearly basis. The pipeline defines a dimensional model by creating a fact (roll call vote) table and multiple dimension tables which contain information on members, vote metadata and congressional committees. The data used is for the current (118th) US Congress.

This project was created for the (Data Talks Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp)[https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main]. See the 'Future Improvements' section for planned improvements to the pipeline.
